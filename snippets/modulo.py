#Modulo is the remainder

#EG: 4 into 11 - how mant time does 4 go into 11...
#Twice, witht he reaminder 3
#3 is the modulo
x = 11 % 4
print(x)

#Any positive number that is less than the positive number to be modulo against is always hat number:

x = 5 % 6
#x = 5
print(x)

x = 5 % 464755895
#x = 5
print(x)
